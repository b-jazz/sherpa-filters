* Finished up enough work to get a beta build out there.

* Bayes filters are implemented and do a pretty good job.

* Added the compiled help to the application.

* Updated all of the source files with the GPL comments at the top.

* Put a form in the application to display the GPL.

* Created a bunch of empty files as an outline for the help topics. A
  couple of the summary files do have some information in them, but
  nowhere near enough to get started using Sherpa if you are a
  novice. More help file content on the way soon.

 * Converted the email messages hash of headers to be a little bit
   more standardized by making the "Received" collection of header
   lines be a plain old string, and made a special key of "Received:"
   (note the colon) that is a list of Received lines. This will make a
   HeaderMatch against the Received lines possible.

 * The rest is mostly just to keep my changes offsite somewhere. This
   set of changes is mostly to support some Bayes Filters feature that
   I discovered at http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html. Until I get to
   a feature complete state and can write some documentation, you'll
   have to email for help or "use the source, Luke" as documentation.

 * Added some more logging of errors (if the user has the logging
   feature turned on.)

 * Wrote the basic code to handle editing the filter file from within
   the application so that you don't have to quit Sherpa, edit the
   filter, and then restart Sherpa. There are still some bugs here,
   but it is a good start.

 * Figured out the simple way to bring up Sherpa showing the Options
   panel when the user hasn't configured the options yet.

 * Fixed 594339: very first run of Sherpa would crash when you tried
   to save your preferences because it tried to abort a thread that
   was never started.

 * Fixed 595082: changing the poll reset the counters.

 * Fixed 595153: timer and stats weren't updated when there was no
   email to filter.

 * Implemented 593691: Sherpa now logs to its very own log file in
   EventViewer so that it doesn't clog up the application log.

 * Implemented 594160: Sherpa showed the spam/day count, but didn't
   show how much normal mail (non-spam) was received per day.

 * Added an option to turn on/off logging of events and errors to
   EventViewer.

 * Added an installer project so that an installation package would be
   generated and you can run Sherpa outside of the development
   environment.

 * Functionaly equivalent to the version that was written in Visual
   Basic.

 * Logs to EventViewer instead of a 32K text field.

 * Verifies the filters file against a Schema instead of a DTD.

 * Starts to abstract the data provider functionality into an abstract
   class so that we can have a MAPI, POP3, and/or IMAP provider
   class. We'll see.

 * Displays some simple counts of how much spam vs. real mail is being
   received and what kind of percentage of spam you're seeing.

 * Calculates how much spam per day you get.
