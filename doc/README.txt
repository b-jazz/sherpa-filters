Sherpa requires the .Net libraries to be installed on your
computer. If you haven't already installed it for some other reason,
you'll need to download it now. You can download it straight from
Microsoft at

| About Sherpa Filters |
+----------------------+

Sherpa was born out of some frustrations with Outlook's Rules Wizard
and the limitions around those rules. You could only have so many
kilobytes of rules (it was never clear to me how much that was) and
you couldn't do even the most basic of regular expressions as far as I
could tell.

I decided that it was time to write something better. This is my
second attempt (the first was written in Visual Basic) at that and it
should only improve from here.

Today, you have to craft the rules by hand in XML. It might sound
scary, but it is really pretty simple. Some help files that discuss
the format are on the way shortly. For now, you should be able to
follow the filter examples in the Samples file.
