<P>Like my license plate says, "I hate spam." I hate it with a
passion. And it is only getting worse. I started writing Rules in
Outlook to help get rid of the spam, but the Exchange server has a
limit on how many rules you can have, so I decided to write my own
software that would filter spam for me without the limitations that
Exchange puts on Rules.</P>

<P>While Sherpa currently isn't as full featured as the Rules built
into Outlook/Exchange, it has some better filters for fighting
spam. You can essentially do only one thing with a message. You can
move it to another folder, and that's it. But as Sherpa grows and
(hopefully) gains some popularity and users, more features will be
implemented.</P>

<P>I would look at the spam I was getting and try to find out ways to
tell that it was spam. Each time I found a new way that a spammer was
sending spam, I would either write a new filter rule for it, or
implement a new feature in Sherpa that could detect it. There are some
types of filters that are probably unique to Sherpa.</P>

<P>Here are some of the types of filters that Sherpa supports:
<UL>
<LI>HeaderMatch - check a specified header (like "From:") for a string
or regular expression that you provide.</LI>
<LI>BodyMatch - just like HeaderMatch, but checks the body of the
message for a string or regular expression.</LI>
<LI>HeaderExists - we used another spam tool for a while that marked
spam with a special header. This rule will see if that header line
exists in the message.</LI>
<LI>RelayDomain - a lot of spam that I get comes through foreign email
servers. If I see a foreign one that isn't listed in my exceptions
list, I consider it spam.</LI>
<LI>ContactMatch - create a white list of people that can send you
email by matching up the sender with people that are in your Contacts
database.</LI>
<LI>Bayes - a popular, and great, new way of detecting spam by
comparing incoming email with a large sample of existing spam.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Download Sherpa today and give it a try. If you have any problems
with it, I'd love to know what they are so that I can improve
it. Thanks.</P>
