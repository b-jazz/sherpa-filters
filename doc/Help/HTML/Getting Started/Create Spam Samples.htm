<H3>Create Spam Samples</H3>

<P>If you'd like to make use of the powerful Bayes filter abilities of Sherpa, you'll need to set up two folders that contain samples of at least 500 spam messages as well as 500 messages that are not spam. For those that are not spam, you should choose a good cross section of your normal email.</P>

<P>The folders that you create will need to be on your Exchange server, but other than that, it doesn't matter where you put them. There is a configuration panel in Sherpa that allows you to specify the path to those folders.</P>

<P>When you run Sherpa with the spam samples set up, Sherpa will take several minutes to start up and read through all of those messages and build up a database of words that are common to spam messages and a database of words that are common to your normal email messages. Once it has generated those databases, Sherpa can determine the probability that a new message that you receive could be considered spam.</P>

<P>Sherpa will only have to chug at those samples once and then it stores a compact representation of those databases for future use. If you continue to add to those sample folders (which is a good idea), you'll want to regenerate those databases again. (More on that later.)</P>

<P>If you want to read more about the technology, this is a <A HREF="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">good summary</A> for those technically inclined.
