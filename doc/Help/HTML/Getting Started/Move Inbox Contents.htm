<H3>Moving Your Inbox Contents</H3>

<P>For the current versions of Sherpa, we treat the Inbox as a temporary place to store incoming files. Anything that comes into the Inbox is filtered and moved to another location. If you store your working set of email in your Inbox, you'll need to move it to another location. <I>This requirement will go away in a later version of Sherpa.</I></P>

<P>It is recommended that you create a folder in your <B>Mailboxes</B> folder that is called <B>In</B> or <B>Inbox</B>. After you've created that folder, select all of the items in the original folder and drag them into your new Inbox.</P>
