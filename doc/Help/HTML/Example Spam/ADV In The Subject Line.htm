<H3>ADV In The Subject Line</H3>

<P>Some government agency decided that the best way to stop spam was
to make it a law that you had to put "ADV:" as the first four letters
of the subject line to make it clear to the receiver that they were
receiving an advertisement. On one hand, this didn't stop spam, but on
the other hand, some spammers are following the rule. Although some
are trying to get cute by putting ADV somewhere else in the subject
line instead of the start.</P>

<H3>Examples</H3>

<P>Here are three examples of how to write the subject line value to
look for, depending on how strict you want to be.</P>

<OL>
<LI>Only look for ADV at the start of the subject line.<BR>
<PRE>&lt;Value&gt;^ADV&lt;/Value&gt;</PRE></LI>

<LI>Look for ADV surrounded by non-word characters like (ADV), [ADV],
and the like. Note that we want zero or one non-word characters at the
start since we still want to catch ADV at the start of the line.<BR>
<PRE>&lt;Value&gt;\W?ADV\W+&lt;/Value&gt;</PRE></LI>

<LI>Look for ADV anywhere in the subject line. Be careful though, this
might catch words like advice. <I>The current version of Sherpa forces
you to use case insensitive searches, but that will change in the next
minor release.</I><BR>
<PRE>&lt;Value&gt;ADV&lt;/Value&gt;</PRE></LI>
</OL>

<H3>Complete Filter Example</H3>

<P><PRE>
&lt;Filter Name="SPAM: ADV In Subject Line" Enabled="true" Tag="Spam"&gt;
  &lt;Criteria&gt;
    &lt;HeaderMatch&gt;
      &lt;Header&gt;Subject&lt;/Header&gt;
      &lt;Value&gt;\W?ADV\W+&lt;/Value&gt;
    &lt;/HeaderMatch&gt;
  &lt;/Criteria&gt;
  &lt;Actions&gt;
    &lt;Move&gt;
      &lt;Destination&gt;Mailboxes/Spam&lt;/Destination&gt;
    &lt;/Move&gt;
  &lt;/Actions&gt;
  &lt;Stats&gt;
    &lt;TestCounter&gt;0&lt;/TestCounter&gt;
    &lt;MatchCounter&gt;0&lt;/MatchCounter&gt;
    &lt;FilterTime&gt;0&lt;/FilterTime&gt;
    &lt;LastMatchTime&gt;&lt;/LastMatchTime&gt;
  &lt;/Stats&gt;
&lt;/Filter&gt;
