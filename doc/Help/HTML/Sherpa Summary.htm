<H3>Sherpa Filters Summary</H3>

<P>Sherpa Filters is a tool that let's you create some very powerful filters to help you organize your email and help you to fight the onslaught of spam.</P>

<P>The current version of Sherpa is a standalone application that connects up to an Exchange server. At some point in the future, both of those issues will change and Sherpa will be integrated in with Outlook and will be able to handle information sources other than just Exchange. The first priority is to make the filtering feature set complete.</P>

<P>In order to write filters for Sherpa, you need to read the documentation. In the current version of Sherpa, the filters are specified in XML and there is no user interface for you to pick a rule and buttons and checkboxes to click to change the rule. This might sound hardcore and difficult, but it really isn't that hard. Just look at the example filter file, and look over the documentation, and you should be okay.</P>
