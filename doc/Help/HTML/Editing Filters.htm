<H3>Editing Filters</H3>

<P>We'll go into the contents of the filters later on in the
documentation. This page will explain how filters are saved and how
you should go about editing them.</P>

<P>When Sherpa first launches, it loads in the filters from the file
that is specified in the Options. While Sherpa is running, it
periodically writes out a copy of the filters to disk. If you make any
changes to the file with an external text editor while Sherpa is
running, your changes will be overwritten by Sherpa.</P>

<P>If you want to edit your filters, you can use the ultra-cheesey
editor that is available from the Filters tab in the main
window. Another (much better) alternative, is to quit Sherpa, use a
real editor to edit and save your new filters, and then relaunch
Sherpa.</P>

<P><I>Later versions of Sherpa will use a GUI to edit the filters
instead of writing the XML file by hand.</I></P>.
