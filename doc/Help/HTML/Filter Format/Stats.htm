<H3>Stats</H3>

<P>The stats sections holds some statistics about the filter that
might be interesting to you. You most likely wouldn't want to edit the
data in this section unless you wanted to reset the counters for some
reason.</P>

<P>
  <IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="Actions" SRC="../../Images/Stats.gif">
</P>

<P><B>TestCounter</B> is the number of times that this particular
filter has been tested against email messages.</P>

<P><B>MatchCounter</B> is the number of times that the filter has
matched an email message.</P>

<P><B>FilterTime</B> is currently unused. In the future, it might hold
the amount of time that the filter took to process.</P>

<P><B>LastMatchTime</B> shows the date and time when the filter last
matched against a message. This can be useful in determining if a
filter ever gets used anymore. If not, you might want to delete it, or
find some way to change the rule to be more effective.</P>

<H3>Stats Example</H3>

<P>This shows the stats section that you should start with on your
filters. Go ahead and leave LastMatchTime blank and it will be filled
in the first time your filter is matched.</P>
