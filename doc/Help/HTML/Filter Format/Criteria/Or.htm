<H3>Or</H3>

<P>Combines two or more criteria. If any of the sub-criteria match, then
the overall criteria triggers a match.</P>

<P>As the graphic above demonstrates, you can next any criteria inside
an <B>Or</B> criteria. This even includes more <B>And</B>, <B>Or</B>,
and <B>Not</B> critera, so you can have very complex statements.</P>

<H3>Or Example</H3>

<P>I've been banging my head on this for a while trying to come up
with a good example of when to use the Or criteria, but I just can't
find one. The usage is simple enough though and looks very similar to
the And criteria. Most situations can be handled by the fact that
several of the other criteria have implicit Or's built into them.</P>
