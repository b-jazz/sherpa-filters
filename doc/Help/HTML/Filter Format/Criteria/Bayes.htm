<H3>Bayes</H3>

<P>A powerful filter that analyzes a set of normal email and a set of
spam email to come up with a list of words and the probabilities that
those words belong to a spam message.</P>

</P>

<P>To configure a filter that makes use of Bayes filtering is
trivial. The Bayes filter simply returns a number between 0 and 100
that indicates the probability that a message is spam. Any message
that has a higher probability than you specify in the <B>Value</B>
will result in the criteria matching.</P>

<P>You can play around with the value that you use, but a recommended
value is somewhere between 90 and 97.</P>

<H3>Bayes Example</H3>

<P>This example uses a fairly aggressive value for defining what a
spam message is.</P>
