<H3>Filter Format Basics</H3>

<P>The Sherpa filters are expressed in an XML file. The structure is
pretty simple. There is some header information, then the single
&lt;Filters&gt; tag that encloses multiple &lt;Filter&gt; tags.</P>

<P>The filters are examined in order, top to bottom, and the first
filter that matches the email message performs its actions and then no
more filters are checked.</P>

<P>Here is the most basic Sherpa filter that you can have.</P>

<P>
<PRE>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Filters Version="1" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="file:///C:/Program Files/IH8SPAM/Sherpa Filters/SherpaFilterSchema.xsd"&gt;
&lt;/Filters&gt;
</PRE>
</P>

<P>The filter format version that this version of Sherpa understands
is anything up to and including version 1. Future versions of Sherpa
might understand later versions of the filter and will be able to
auto-upgrade older versions to the current version.</P>

<P>If for some reason, you install Sherpa outside of the standard
location, or on a different drive letter, make sure you change the URL
listed in the second line.</P>
