<H3>Regular Expressions</H3>

<P>Regular Expressions (regex's) are kind of difficult to
explain. Regex's are very powerful way of describing a range of
possible text values.</P>

<P>Say, for instance, that your friend Tom can send
you mail from many different computers in the same company. One day
you might get mail from tom@pinky.company.com and the next day, you
might get mail from tom@brain.company.com. If you want to express both
of those addresses with one statement, you could write
<I>tom@.*\.company\.com</I>.</P>

<P>There are so many types of regex's that it would be impossible for
me to document them all. What you should really do is visit the
Microsoft site that documents the complete regular
expressions that Sherpa makes use of.</P>
