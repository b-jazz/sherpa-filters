<H3>Spam Corpus</H3>

<P>If you have chosen to make use of the Bayes filtering capabilities of Sherpa, you need to have a folder of email that contains at least 500 spam email messages, where spam is defined as mail that you are not  interested in. Sherpa uses this information to figure out what a spam email looks like and if you use the Bayes filters, the better the collection of email here, the better filtering it can do.</P>

<P>Put the name of the mail folder in this field. The path should be a relative path starting after "Outlook Today" and should use forward slashes as folder separators just like in the web world.</P>

<P>We have not studied the performance of the Bayes filters and how they are affected by the number of emails in the corpus. I would shoot for between 500 and 5,000 messages.</P>
