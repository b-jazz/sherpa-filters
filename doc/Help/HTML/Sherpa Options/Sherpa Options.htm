<H3>Sherpa Options</H3>

<P>The options for Sherpa are set on two different tabs of the Main
window. The first place is called <I>Options</I> and the second is
called <I>Bayes</I>. The Options panel has most of the settings you'll
need for getting Sherpa running. The Bayes panel is for setting
options related to Bayes filters.</P>
