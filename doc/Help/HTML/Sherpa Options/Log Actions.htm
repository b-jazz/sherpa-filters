<H3>Log Actions</H3>

<P>To have Sherpa log any actions it takes while it is running, you should check this option. Sherpa will log any errors that it finds while running, as well as every message that it acts on. It is recommended that you have this feature turned on when you are first creating your filters so you can go through the logs and find out which rules have acted on your messages and where they have ended up.</P>

<P>The information that is logged is the name of the filter, the action that was taken, and the important headers (From, To, Subject).</P>

<P>You can access the logs by using the Event Viewer. They are logged into their own section in Event Viewer, so you can change the settings in Event Viewer to customize how many logs you want to keep. Maybe you'll only want to keep 1 MB of logs, or maybe you'll only want to keep 24 hours worth of logs.</P>
