<H3>Exchange Server</H3>

<P>Put the name of your Exchange server in this field. Whatever server name you found out from your Outlook settings will suffice for this field. It doesn't have to be a fully qualified domain name (exchange.company.com) if it isn't that way in Outlook. But you can put a full qualified name in here, or even an IP address.</P>
