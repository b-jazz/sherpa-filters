<H3>Default Mailbox</H3>

<P>This will most likely never be different from "Inbox".</P>

<P>If you have a complex situation where you have Outlook rules wizard, or some other filtering product, do some initial filtering and put the results somewhere else, and you want Sherpa to act on those items, you would change it to be the name of that folder.</P>

<P>The value for Default Mailbox should be the relative path starting after "Outlook Today". For instance, "Inbox" in most cases, or something like "Mailboxes/PostOutlook" if you have Outlook do the initial filtering. In this case, you'll need to use the forward slash that is common in the web world to seperate folder names.</P>
