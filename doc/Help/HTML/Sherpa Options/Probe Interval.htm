<P>This will set the number of seconds to wait between polling the Exchange server for new mail. Set this number low if you want to get mail from your Inbox filtered as soon as possible. But don't set it too low or you might catch the attention of your Exchange administrator wondering why you are driving up the load on the server.</P>
