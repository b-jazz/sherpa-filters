<H3>Sherpa Filter Locations</H3>

<P>This is the path to your existing filter file. You might want to switch between a couple of different filters for some reason and can change this option to point Sherpa to the different filters. If this is the first time you've used Sherpa and you haven't written a filter yet, go ahead and leave this blank and Sherpa will create a filter file for you and give you a chance to save the file at that time.</P>

<P>The path for the filter file should be fully qualified and the folder character separator is the normal backslash used in Windows.</P>
